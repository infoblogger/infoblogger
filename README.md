You have already created and published your new website. Great! Now, it was time for the public to visit her. Normally, most of the traffic to a web page comes from search engines like Google, Yahoo or Bing. Search engine optimization (or SEO) is about making adjustments to your website to increase the chances that it will appear among the first search results when the topics are relevant.

It may sound strange at first, but the good news is that even newcomers to the world of web pages can take care of SEO. In this article, we introduce you to the basics of SEO and how to get started with your own site.

Why is search engine optimization important?

SEO is important because being among the first search results will bring you more visitors. It is also important because good search engine positioning allows you to get the right visitors : people who are looking for what you offer.

Most people click on the first search result the search engine shows them. So if you can get your page to come out first, great! You can even appear in a featured snippet or in a Google reply box.

An interesting aspect to consider? Search engines don't necessarily rank the biggest, prettiest, and most expensive web pages at the top, but rather pick the ones that have the best answers to the question a visitor is asking.

Bottom line: The trick to SEO lies in 1) including relevant content on your website that answers your visitors' questions and 2) making sure that content is easily read and understood by search engines.

Most articles on SEO use Google as an example or as a synonym for search engines. The reason is simple: almost 90% of search queries are made on Google. However, these tips can also be applied to other search engines such as Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo.

How do search engines like Google work?

A search engine is a list or an index of web pages that is constantly updated.

Search engines use web crawlers (also known as "spiders") that browse the web for new pages. The best way to understand it is, perhaps, to imagine a spider moving through the invisible parts of a web code 24 hours a day, every day. Crawlers start with popular pages and follow the links that redirect them to other pages. In this way, they create an infinite network.

When crawlers find a new web page, they add it to their page list for indexing and then, based on the type of information it presents, determine what it is. For that they focus, among other things, on the texts, images, titles and links.

Once the crawlers find and collect this information, the search engine uses a search algorithm to rank the web page in relation to different keywords and phrases.

Eventually, when your page is published, search engine crawlers can find it.

To speed up the process, you can connect your website to the Google Search Console tool.

Here you can find more information on how to get Google to find your website.

How do search engine algorithms work?

Search engines don't reveal their algorithms exactly because they don't want people to cheat the system. However, some factors are widely known: including clear texts, titles, alt text, keywords and backlinks is of utmost importance. Search engines also reward factors that make a website easier or safer to use, such as optimization for mobile devices and the HTTPS security protocol (Jimdo provides both functions automatically).

In fact, there are about 200 Google SEO factors that make the difference between a web page that Google likes and one that maybe not. Some are quite definitive, others are more of a speculative matter. If you look at the list, you can see that SEO has something mysterious about it. This explains why people create a bit of a stir trying to get a head start when Google updates its algorithms.

This is also a reason not to blindly believe those who claim to be SEO experts when they assure you that they will get you more traffic. It is likely that many of them are just wanting to sell pig for a hare.

If you continue reading, you will find the factors that are easy to adapt to your website and whose effectiveness is already proven .

What parts of SEO can I take?

Once you understand how search engines work, you can customize your website and content to reach as many Google users as possible.

Although it is not complete, this list is a great starting point. And if we consider that many people do not even open the SEO settings of their website, starting with this can give you a great advantage.

Some peculiarities that search engines like:

Original content, of value, attractive and written for people, not for search engines.
Keywords and key phrases used naturally. If you use keywords that users typically type in their Google searches, they are more likely to find you. There are many myths about keywords, so be sure to check out our guide to keywords for beginners.
Structured content. Include a Main Title (H1 tag) at the beginning of each subpage, with medium and small subtitles below so that the content is divided into sections that can be understood.
Fill in a title for the site and titles for the subpages in the SEO settings. This indicates how your page will appear in search results.
Reputable web page backlinks . A backlink is a link that allows you to get from another web page to yours. If someone includes a link to your page on theirs, they are somehow endorsing your website and saying that they like your content and want their visitors to see it. This Google loves.
Internal and external links. Links to other subpages of your website (internal) or to other websites (external) help web crawlers understand how your content fits together. No web page or subpage should be isolated.
Alternative texts (alt-text) that describe what is seen in your images.
Mobile optimized web pages that have good mobile designs.
Clear navigation menus that are easy to read and understand.
Content updated regularly. This gives the search engines a guideline that the information on your website is accurate and up-to-date.

SEO strategies to avoid:

The knowledge about conventional SEO from a few years ago is no longer up to date enough. Over the years, Google has added more nuance to its ranking factors and this has improved searches in general and made them more captivating.

For example, people used to fill their keyword content to achieve a certain “keyword density” with the belief that this would help them rank higher. Today, Google rewards natural language and, in fact, penalizes web pages that appear fake for being full of keywords that are repeated all over the place.

So you might hear some people recommend some of these outdated strategies, but it's best to skip them to avoid a penalty.

Overuse of keywords
Use of irrelevant keywords
Pages with little or even no content
Pages with repeating content
Participation in link schemes
Hidden text or links
